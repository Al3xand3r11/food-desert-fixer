This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## What is this

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- We often wonder especially how we as young black adults can make a difference in our community, even if we lack capital, the resources or maybe even the know how to rejuvenate and revitalize those communities around us. Food deserts are places of sparse access when it comes to fresh produce, meats and overall just healthier alternatives to a corner store or quick mart that has to cover swaths of land. This is a problem that also affects the black and brown community at much higher rates as well so some of family and friends may directly be affected by the lack of these resources. Maybe even yourself. And that is why my inspiration is so strong. Although I may not have spent the majority of my time building it, I spent it brainstorming and determining what resources and information can help someone today make a difference with also a possible roadmap to the future and to get people even more engaged on a project like this. I didn’t look at this as just a hackathon project. But a springboard to make meaningful change in some people’s life who are losing a battle to food security that were never given the tools to fight to begin with. 

## What it does

- It utilizes the OpenAI API to utilize map technology and prompting to determine the closest food desert relative to the zipcode given. Based on that zipcode, you will be given information such as local food banks, congressional contact and even local abandoned buildings that could serve as the new home for a grocery store.


## What May Be Next

- I really want this to be seen as a concept for something so much greater that may even outpace me as a single developer. Features like allowing food banks to have spaces on the web app so that people who may not even be in the area but have cause for concern for a certain zipcode can send important items. Local schedule of town hall meetings to bring up concerns about food insecurity. A dashboard of locations suffering the most from food insecurity and an interactive map that can pinpoint places and show instantly local initiatives
